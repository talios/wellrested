Welcome to the wellrested sandbox for a HATEOAS compliant REST API.

The aim of the project is to provide a sample REST API application, that actually conforms to the HATEOAS
REST philosophy: using links, and hypermedia to navigate and drive the application.

## REST Conventions used

Before reading further, some conventions used:

 * Media type distinction is currently handled with "rel" attributes on the standard application/json style media
   types as using application/customthing+json was causing issues with the Compojure web framework.
 * The HTTP method PATCH is being used for non CRUD operations against resources

## Starting the API

You can start the API by launching the clojure repl:

    $ mvn clojure:repl

## API Entry Point

Once the system is running, the primary endpoint of the API can be found at:

    http://localhost:8080

Currently, only one type of resource is currently provided by the API - "the staff list", the availability of this resource
is known when a link with the relationship "stafflist" is returned.

## The Staff List

The staff list resource is available in various different views, different views can be requested by a client by setting
the Accept: header when requesting the resource.  If not set, then the default 

    application/json; rel=wellrested-stafflist

media type will be returned.

### Media Type: application/json; rel=wellrested-stafflist

This is the default staff list media type, it contains a _filtered_ list of active staff members.

The document is a JSON array, with each element containing a series of JSON-Schema link objects, which identify
further things to do with the individual record.

    Link: <xxxxx>; rel=\"create\"; type=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded; rel=wellrested-newstaffmember\"; title=\"Create a new staff member\"; method=\"POST\""
    Accept-Patch: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; rel=wellrested-announcement
    
    [
      {
        "links":[
          {
            "rel":"view",
            "url":"xxxxx",
            "type":"application\/wellrested-staffmember+json"
          },{
            "rel":"delete",
            "url":"xxxxx",
            "method":"DELETE"
          }],
        "id":"0c6d5bfc-5e1f-455e-b46d-3b873868519a",
        "name":"Mark",
        "status":"active"
      }
    ]

As we are a small startup organization which doesn't wish to grow too large, if new staff members can be hired, an HTTP
"Link" header for the "create" relation is provided, and operations on the resource can be performed by submitting PATCH
requests containing requests identified via the Accept-Patch header.

### Media Type: application/json; rel=wellrested-fullstafflist

This is a variation of the "application/json; rel=wellrested-stafflist" media type in that deleted staff members are not
removed from the list.

## Sending announcements to staff collections

On resources which allow clients to trigger notifications, the "Accept-Patch" HTTP header will include:

    application/x-www-form-urlencoded; rel=wellrested-announcement

This is a standard URL encoded form containing:

  * message - the message to send

## Creating staff members

Creating staff members is achieved by submitting the following media types where requested:

    application/x-www-form-urlencoded; rel=wellrested-newstaffmember

This is a standard URL encoded form containing the following parameters:

  * name - the new staff members name

If there are too many staff members, then a 400 response will be issued.
